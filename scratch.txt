### RASPBERRY PI ZERO 2W POWER SPECS ###

--- IDLE MODE ---
Only RPi Zero On w/ screen and keyboard connected, Wifi on
Input Voltage       [VIN]       12.0 V
Current             [I]         0.21 A
Voltage to RPi      [Vr]        5.0  V

Only RPi Zero On w/ Wifi on
Input Voltage       [VIN]       12.0 V
Current             [I]         0.12 A
Voltage to RPi      [Vr]        5.0  V

Device          Current     Power
RPi [Idle]      0.11 A      1.32 W
Keyboard        0.07 A      0.84 W
HDMI Screen     0.02 A      0.24 W
Wifi            <0.3 A      3.6  W [Only when processing and in the form of spikes up to 0.3 A]
Regulator       0.01 A      0.12 W

Note: Keyboard pulls an additional 0.07 A and the HDMI screen pulls 0.02 A. Wifi seems to only
pull current when actively connecting to something which can spike by 0.30 A more. When idling
wifi does not contribute to the total current consumption. Astrid reports the RPi when idling
pulls 0.11 A with nothing connected. We use an adjustable linear voltage regulator to convert
VIN to Vr. This implies the Regulator current consumption is about 0.01 A. Wifi current
consumption also includes any additional current pulled due to processing power for example
running "sudo apt upgrade" can reach a total current of 0.47 A.

Note: When HDMI and keyboard are connected during startup the current pulled can raise up to
0.46 A for the whole board. It reduces to 0.21A when idle.

### DATA TAKING ELECTRONICS POWER SPECS ###

--- IDLE MODE ---
Input Voltage       [VIN]       12.0 V
Current             [I]         0.37 A [Irregular jumps to 0.4 A]




Board Design Errors
- Replace the 2.5V fixed Linear Regulator for Low Voltage Drop ones
- Vias around amp voltage regulator are not copper exposed
- RPi does not read analog signals it can only read digital signals
